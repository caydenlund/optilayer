# OptiLayer

This repository contains a tool for performing topological optimization on
STL models, aimed at enhancing structural integrity while minimizing mass.
The tool utilizes density-based finite element analysis
to iteratively adjust material distribution within the design space.


## Note to Graders

If you're reading this note, then I have unmerged changes.
The state of this branch of the repository does not contain the current working
version; it's on a private development branch.
I intend to make a working version, then clean it up, then merge it into main,
but if I don't finish cleaning it up and merging it into main by the time
you're examining the code, then you'll need to wait a couple of days first.
